create a new repository in the github

link remote repo with local repo (origin is conventional name)
git remote add origin <repo link>

git remote, git remote -v - view remote repository

git remote remove <name> - remove remote repository

upload to remote repository
git push origin <branch name>

git push --set-upstream origin master - next time git push can be used to make push

we can only push one branch at a time to a remote repository

git push only pushes commits and not changes which are in the staging / working area

If we overwrite a local commit, then the remote commit will automatically gets branched.
push will fail. To overwrite it in remote use git push origin master -f

downloading from github
git fetch - fetch the changes from remote repository
git pull origin master - sync with new commits in local repository

git pull origin master --set-upstream - next time use git pull
