git branch <branch name> - create a new branch

git branch - view all branches

git checkout <branch name> - switch to that branch

Merging merges the current working branch with another branch
git checkout master
git merge branching_demo -m "merged branches"

merge will create a new commit

If there is a merge conflict then resolve it manually and then create a commit to complete the merge.
